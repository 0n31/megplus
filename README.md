Built by [TomNomNom](https://github.com/TomNomNom) and [EdOverflow](https://github.com/EdOverflow).

## About

This wrapper will automate numerous tasks and help you during your reconnaissance process. The script finds common issues, low hanging fruit, and assists you when approaching a target. meg+ also allows you to scan **all** your in-scope targets on HackerOne in one go ‚Äî it simply retrieves them using a GraphQL query.
